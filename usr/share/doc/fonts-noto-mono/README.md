# Noto fonts

Noto's goal is to provide a beautiful reading experience for everyone and for all languages. With visual harmony when multiple languages share a page. With multiple styles and weights. And **_Freely available to all._**

Currently, Noto covers all major languages of the world and many others, including European, African, Middle Eastern, Indic, South and Southeast Asian, Central Asian, American, and East Asian languages. Several minority and historical languages are also supported.

Support for Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean was first added in July 2014.

You can preview and download the Noto fonts at http://www.google.com/get/noto.

Noto fonts are open source. All fonts are published under the [SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).  (Prior to September 29, 2015, Noto fonts other than CJK were published under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).)

Use unhinted fonts for Android and Mac (Android and Mac ignore hinting information embedded in fonts). Use hinted fonts for other platforms.

## Development

All Noto fonts are included in this repository, except:

  * Noto CJK fonts are in [noto-cjk](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-cjk),
  * Noto Emoji and Noto Color Emoji are in [noto-emoji](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji).

Tools used for testing fonts are in [nototools](https://github.com/googlei18n/nototools).

Noto was moved from Google Code to github in June 2015.

Development and user discussions happen on the [noto-font Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/noto-font).

## Special Note on Droid and Noto
Droid fonts have been superseded by Noto. We renamed Droid fonts to Noto and only update the Noto family since renaming. Now, Noto not only gives better support to all languages covered by Droid (in terms of more characters and fewer bugs), but also covers many more languages. Both Android and Chrome OS have switched to Noto. We strongly recommend everyone to replace Droid with Noto and check out new languages supported by Noto in this repo.
