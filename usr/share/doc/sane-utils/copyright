License: Artistic
 The "Artistic License"
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
 reasonable modifications.
 .
 Definitions:
 .
  "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
  Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
  created through textual modification.
 .
  "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
  modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
  of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
 .
  "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
  copyrights for the package.
 .
  "You" is you, if you are thinking about copying or distributing
  this Package.
 .
  "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
  basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
  and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
  Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
  as a market that must bear the fee.)
 .
  "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
  itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
  It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
  under the same conditions they received it.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
 duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
 modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
 that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
 when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
 following:
 .
  a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
  Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
  an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
  site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
  your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 .
  b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 .
  c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
  with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
  a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
  documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 .
  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
  a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
  together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
  to get the Standard Version.
 .
  b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
  the Package with your modifications.
 .
  c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
  document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
  with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 .
  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
 Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
 Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
 you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
 commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
 distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
 product of your own.
 .
 6. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
 products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
 .
 7. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

License: GFDL-1.1
 0. PREAMBLE
 .
 The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written
 document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
 freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
 commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for
 the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
 considered responsible for modifications made by others.
 .
 This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
 the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
 GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
 software.
 .
 We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
 because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with
 manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is
 not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
 regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We
 recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
 reference.
 .
 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
 .
 This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed
 by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this
 License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member
 of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".
 .
 A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or
 a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
 translated into another language.
 .
 A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
 Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
 authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
 matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
 subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
 a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could
 be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
 or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
 regarding them.
 .
 The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
 designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
 the Document is released under this License.
 .
 The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
 Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
 Document is released under this License.
 .
 A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
 represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
 public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly
 with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
 programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
 suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety
 of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
 Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
 subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
 "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
 .
 Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
 without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
 publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
 modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
 can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
 which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
 machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
 only.
 .
 The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
 following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
 requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
 any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
 appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
 text.
 .
 2. VERBATIM COPYING
 .
 You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or
 noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
 license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
 all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
 License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
 or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
 accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
 number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 .
 You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
 publicly display copies.
 .
 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
 .
 If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the
 Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in
 covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
 Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
 must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
 The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
 prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
 of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
 copying in other respects.
 .
 If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
 should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
 cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
 .
 If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than
 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with
 each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
 computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the
 Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has
 access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
 protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent
 steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
 that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
 until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
 (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
 .
 It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
 Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
 a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 .
 4. MODIFICATIONS
 .
 You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
 conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
 Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
 role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
 Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must
 do these things in the Modified Version:
 .
 A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
 that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
 there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may
 use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
 version gives permission.
 B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
 responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
 together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
 of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
 C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
 Version, as the publisher.
 D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
 E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
 the other copyright notices.
 F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
 giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
 of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
 G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
 and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
 H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
 I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it
 an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of
 the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
 entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
 authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
 add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
 sentence.
 J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
 access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
 locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
 These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
 location for a work that was published at least four years before the
 Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
 gives permission.
 K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve
 the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and
 tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
 therein.
 L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
 text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
 considered part of the section titles.
 M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
 included in the Modified Version.
 N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict
 in title with any Invariant Section.
 .
 If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
 that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
 Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
 invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
 the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from
 any other section titles.
 .
 You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
 but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
 statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
 organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
 .
 You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage
 of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts
 in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of
 Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one
 entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
 previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
 acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
 one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
 one.
 .
 The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
 permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
 endorsement of any Modified Version.
 .
 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,
 under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided
 that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of
 the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of
 your combined work in its license notice.
 .
 The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
 identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
 are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
 make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
 parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
 if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
 titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
 combined work.
 .
 In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the
 various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
 combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
 "Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."
 .
 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
 released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
 License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
 collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
 copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 .
 You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
 individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
 into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
 regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 .
 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
 .
 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
 independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
 medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
 provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a
 compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
 other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of
 their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
 Document.
 .
 If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
 the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
 aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
 only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
 around the whole aggregate.
 .
 8. TRANSLATION
 .
 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
 translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
 Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
 holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
 addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include
 a translation of this License provided that you also include the original
 English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the
 translation and the original English version of this License, the original
 English version will prevail.
 .
 9. TERMINATION
 .
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
 expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
 sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
 terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
 copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
 .
 The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free
 Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
 spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
 problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
 .
 Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
 Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
 later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
 been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
 Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
 version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
